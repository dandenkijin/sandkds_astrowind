# Tina Admin dev proxy (prevents cross-origin Vite HMR when Tina runs on :4001)
# Forward /admin to the Tina dev server during development.
/admin    http://localhost:4001   200

# IMPORTANT: Never proxy static assets - let the platform serve them from ./dist or ./public
# This ensures /admin/assets/* are served as real JS/CSS files, not by the Astro route.
/admin/assets/*   /admin/assets/:splat   200

# For any other /admin/* path (non-assets), forward to the dev server if it's running
/admin/*  http://localhost:4001/:splat   200

# SPA fallback for the main site (do not catch /admin/assets)
/*    /index.html   200
